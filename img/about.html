Pictureslibrary was launched with a burning desire to create the World's largest collection

India's diversity and complexity can be witnessed through its people who reflect past traditions, cultures and values associated with their distinctive regional customs, habits, food & festivals that are distinctively Indian.

All the images on PicturesLibrary are indicative of the innate expressions of deep-rooted feelings ofindividuals through which spring their day-to-day actions, postures and expressions. Indians believe in sharing happiness and sorrow together as a community. While doing so, Indians share unique mannerisms and expressions which are captured in our extensive library of creative imagery.</br>
